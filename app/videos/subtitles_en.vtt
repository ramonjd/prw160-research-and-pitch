00:00.000 --> 00:38.650
(Singing) Started out, last night

00:38.650 --> 00:40.939
Hello!

00:40.939 --> 00:43.328
I’d like to introduce the ideas and background

00:43.328 --> 00:44.703
to the final project for the award of

00:44.703 --> 00:46.243
Masters of Professional Writing.

00:46.243 --> 00:47.936
In this presentation,

00:47.936 --> 00:49.911
I want to address the following questions:

00:49.911 --> 00:51.360
why this story.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.845
Why now.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.549
What’s the market for it.

00:54.549 --> 00:57.885
And why should anyone believe anything a cockatoo has to say?

00:57.885 --> 00:59.140
My project is entitled Sandbanker,

00:59.140 --> 01:02.152
it is a coming of age novel set in

01:02.152 --> 01:05.117
Australia in 1988 - the bicentennial year.

01:05.117 --> 01:06.462
The year of tall ships

01:06.462 --> 01:08.361
the first polymer note.

01:08.361 --> 01:10.314
Some foreign sheila cut a ribbon

01:10.314 --> 01:11.541
at our new parliament house.

01:11.541 --> 01:13.264
There was world expo.

01:13.264 --> 01:15.284
It was also the year that gave the rest

01:15.284 --> 01:17.653
of the planet that beach-side white-bread drama,

01:17.653 --> 01:18.776
Home and Away.

01:18.776 --> 01:21.940
The protagonist and narrator of Sandbanker

01:21.940 --> 01:23.796
is thirteen-year-old, Alex Miller.

01:23.796 --> 01:26.014
Alex lives in Shelly Beach:

01:26.014 --> 01:29.286
a fictitious, isolated town on Australia’s Pacific coast.

01:29.286 --> 01:33.199
With no father and an unstable home life,

01:33.199 --> 01:35.209
Alex finds himself alone.

01:35.209 --> 01:37.057
He dreams of running away from

01:37.057 --> 01:38.555
his erratic mother Dagmar

01:38.555 --> 01:39.930
and her belligerent boyfriend, Terry,

01:39.930 --> 01:42.334
and concocts a plan to head north.

01:42.334 --> 01:44.475
If only he had money.

01:44.475 --> 01:46.804
But his fortunes change when

01:46.804 --> 01:48.632
he encounters ex-bikie Jono,

01:48.632 --> 01:50.970
whom he finds roughing it in a nearby sea-cave.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.438
Alex agrees to help the wounded Jono

01:53.438 --> 01:54.732
and keep his whereabouts secret

01:54.732 --> 01:56.389
from the police in return for money.

01:56.389 --> 02:00.246
The pair soon bond, and Alex learns from his new friend

02:00.246 --> 02:01.374
lessons about life,

02:01.374 --> 02:04.217
the natural environment and human relationships.

02:04.217 --> 02:06.535
Alex soon realises however

02:06.535 --> 02:08.187
that the closer he and Jono become,

02:08.187 --> 02:11.102
the more he puts his own plans and safety at risk.

02:11.102 --> 02:14.035
And when it turns out that Jono is wanted for murder,

02:14.035 --> 02:16.240
and is on the run not only from the police,

02:16.240 --> 02:17.782
but from a treacherous gang leader,

02:17.782 --> 02:20.340
he must decide whether to trust and help Jono

02:20.340 --> 02:22.614
or abandon him and pursue his own agenda.

02:22.614 --> 02:26.252
Before the end, Alex will help clear Jono’s name,

02:26.252 --> 02:30.017
stand up to Terry, and realise what it is to be an adult.

02:30.017 --> 02:33.746
In writing I want to explore themes of friendship, loyalty

02:33.746 --> 02:36.780
and sense of place and belonging that comes from the land.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.367
I developed the story idea and basic narrative structure

02:38.367 --> 02:40.144
I developed the story idea and basic narrative structure

02:40.144 --> 02:41.578
during the Scriptwriting module.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.128
I’d always wanted to set a story in the environment in which I grew up,

02:45.128 --> 02:47.950
not only because I have an intimate knowledge of the land and culture,

02:47.950 --> 02:49.684
or at least remnants of memory,

02:49.684 --> 02:52.078
but I wanted to re-examine the epoque

02:52.078 --> 02:54.925
and dispel the golden-syrupy fantasies I developed while growing up.

02:54.925 --> 02:58.128
For example: Did I really like Guns N Roses?

02:58.128 --> 03:00.078
In the late 1980s, 

03:00.078 --> 03:03.567
Australia had just crawled its way out of recession

03:03.567 --> 03:04.915
and was moaning its way into another.

03:04.915 --> 03:09.512
In 1988 we were told to celebrate the 200th anniversary of European settlement,

03:09.512 --> 03:11.356
without really being told why;

03:11.356 --> 03:13.489
and those who inquired were often dismantled

03:13.489 --> 03:16.771
by gratuitous flag-waving and the smoke of a million summer barbeques.

03:16.771 --> 03:19.730
Politics and the historical events of 1988

03:19.730 --> 03:21.772
will only simmer in the subtext of my story

03:21.772 --> 03:25.153
and while I’m researching news and factual evidence,

03:25.153 --> 03:28.195
my protagonist will observe such things with relative passiveness,

03:28.195 --> 03:30.738
preferring to focus on his immediate situation.

03:30.738 --> 03:34.020
Already I’ve researched general historical facts

03:34.020 --> 03:35.291
such as the prices of common goods,

03:35.291 --> 03:38.338
coastal weather patterns, marine biology,

03:38.338 --> 03:39.838
and the era’s interesting fashion tastes.

03:39.838 --> 03:41.828
As for the setting,

03:41.828 --> 03:43.480
I want to depict a world of sand,

03:43.480 --> 03:47.327
ocean foam, sun and weed, rocks and  limber eucalypts.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.368
The ocean features in a wealth of Australian literature

03:50.368 --> 03:52.603
from teeny novels such as Puberty Blues

03:52.603 --> 03:53.973
to the modern works of Tim Winton

03:53.973 --> 03:56.909
and provides a fitting backdrop to a coming of age novel.

03:56.909 --> 04:00.564
My research has so far consisted of scouring the internet,

04:00.564 --> 04:03.210
reading popular Australian novels, and newspapers,

04:03.210 --> 04:06.147
and quizzing friends and relatives about the glory days.

04:06.147 --> 04:10.577
The bildungsroman genre has a strong history in Australian publishing

04:10.577 --> 04:12.537
and the voices of fiction writing

04:12.537 --> 04:15.685
contributing to the cultural narrative are more diverse than ever before.

04:15.685 --> 04:18.915
Yet the opportunities to take the traditional publishing route

04:18.915 --> 04:20.113
are becoming rarer every year.

04:20.113 --> 04:23.343
What I learned from the industry analysis,

04:23.343 --> 04:25.137
and speaking with first-time authors is that

04:25.137 --> 04:27.595
writing, as difficult as it is,

04:27.595 --> 04:29.906
is only the first half of the pavlova.

04:29.906 --> 04:32.327
After you’ve put the pen down,

04:32.327 --> 04:34.725
you still have to get on with building an author brand,

04:34.725 --> 04:37.924
promoting your work and building online networks.

04:37.924 --> 04:40.635
There are many opportunities for writers

04:40.635 --> 04:42.549
literary prizes and grants and so on

04:42.549 --> 04:44.336
but the marketplace has changed.

04:44.336 --> 04:46.860
People continue to consume books,

04:46.860 --> 04:50.305
yet sales are down and book advances are diminishing.

04:50.305 --> 04:54.368
Compared with the UK and the USA, the Australian market is minuscule.

04:54.368 --> 04:58.554
I have no delusions of success in the Australian fiction market

04:58.554 --> 05:00.131
I only want to finish my book.

        <p><span class="lead">When Charles Dickens</span> delivered the first installment of The Pickwick Papers, the serialised work that would launch his name into the limelight and make him the most popular English-language writer of the Victorian era, he was riding square and neatly on the top of the greatest “mass dissemination” and promotion of literature there had ever been. Publishers Chapman and Hall distributed the monthly letterpress issues via coach up and down the country and via steamer to eager fans on the American continent, and it was not uncommon to see people wandering the streets engrossed in the latest adventures of Nell and her grandfather. </p>

        <p>Dickens was also no slouch when it came to self-promotion: one of his reading tours lasted nearly a year and saw him appear 129 times in 49 different locations across Britain and Ireland. </p>

        <p>The last installment of Dickens’s first official work of literature sold almost 40,000 copies - a colossal figure at the time given the technology and marketing channels available to authors at the time. </p>

        <p>The printing press brought with terrific advancements in the dissemination of literature and continue promotion in the printed media. One can only wonder how far a wealth of talent and hard work, plus a little luck would have carried Dickens in the era of the internet - an age in which, at a click of a button, a message can spread to and be consumed by billions of people.</p>

        <p>In this short piece of research I want to focus on:

        <ol>
            <li>how first-time and do-it-yourself authors <strong>promote themselves online</strong>,</li>
            <li>which <strong>technologies</strong> they use, and </li>
            <li>how the internet - arguably the most significant evolution in information dissemination since the printing press - has helped them claim a slice of the ever-shrinking public’s attention.</li>
        </ol>

 <h2>Tardis to 2014 and the web marketing slam</h2>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Fast-forward to the twittery-first century when publishers are asking all their authors to start blogs, 
        and self-published novelists such as <a class="roll-link" data-title="Hugh Howey" href="http://www.hughhowey.com/">Hugh Howey</a>, the current pin-up boy for do-it-yourself digital marketing success and social media animal, are at any one time attached at the fingertips to dozens of media channels and various promotional technologies to spread the word about their works. </p>

        <p>Hugh connects with his fans by blogging, <a class="roll-link" data-title="tweets" href="https://www.facebook.com/hughhowey">tweets</a>, <a class="roll-link" data-title="facebooking" href="https://www.facebook.com/hughhowey">facebooking</a> and working his <a class="roll-link" data-title="Goodreads" href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3064305.Hugh_Howey">Goodreads</a> account (goodreadings sounds silly as a verb).</p>

        <p>During a talk at the Kobo stand at the London Book Fair this year, he predicted that the future of publishing is the self-styled, hard-working, business-minded, self-publishing author. “You can can start your career in self-publishing and end up wherever you want,” he said.</p>

        <p>And it’s true: for little or no cost at all, anyone can set up an online profile on multiple networks and attempt to promote themselves to the billions of people now online across the world. But this is merely the start of the journey: ensuring people hear your journey is one part, and something online promotion has in common with previous media; now it’s about connecting and sharing and riding the back of the powerful word-of-mouth dissemintation* or share/like/post/insert your favourite positive vibe word here.</p>

  <h1>1988 in Australia <small>Life and events</small></h1>
</div>

<p>Were I to draw solely upon my memories of my childhood in Australia during the 1980s as source material for my novel, I’d probably end up creating a golden-syrup dripping fantasy land in which birds flocked to my shoulders wherever I went and the men and women wearing oversized grey suits and shoulder pads running the country could be taken at their word.</p>

<p>One knows better with age, and a genuine reason why I wanted to set a story in this period, was to examine many of the events of the time, from which my pre-pubescent youth stole their relevance and interestingness. </p>

<p>Australia had just crawled its way out of recession and was sighing and moaning its way into another. In 1988 we were told to celebrate the 200th anniversary of English settlement, without really being told why we should, and when people dared to raise such blasphemies as the maltreatment of the Indigenous population<sup referencelink="6"></sup> or the recent repudiation of the white australia immigration policy conceived at the nation’s federation, their cries were drowned out by dentally endowed media commentators among the gratuitous flag-waving and shimmering barbeque haze.</p>

<p>Similar to me, tHe protagonist in my story will observe most of the events happening beyond his immediate sphere with passivity, oblvious that certain facets of the era affect him and those around him.</p>

<p>In 1988 the average temperature was XX and northern NSW received XXX mm of rain. On a  typical summer's day, the sun would have risen just after 6:00am and set around 8:30 or 9:00pm, allowing plenty of outdoor time.</p>

<p>Long before the advent of Priuses and shining 4WD's, the 'Datto 120', even with a rusted out roof, was the coolest contraption on  tar, and the apogee of Australian social status was the Holden Commodore.</p> 

<p>In 1988, petrol was cheap and the distances were great, and if you'd never cruised at 120km/ph down the highway with your elbow hanging out catching a tan, or driven back from the beach sweating like a dog in a box, you'd never lived. Or didn't have a licence.</p>

<p>Ford Falcon versus Holden Commodore was like Windows verse Mac today: there was just no convincing each side of the others' merits, or that they were, in reality, two versions of the same inanity<sup referencelink="19"></sup>.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> Australia Day Bicentennial celebrations and our convict heritage</h2>
<p>The 200th anniversary of European settlement. In 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip led the eleven-strong fleet into Sydney Cove to establish the first colony. Aboard the ships were 1480 people including, officers, crew and convicts. While most of the prisoners were British, there were also Americans, French and Africans aboard<sup referencelink="20"></sup>.</p>

<p>Many of the convicts had been sentenced for crimes such as XXXX. XXXX XXXX, age XX, was imprisoned for XXXX. ......</p>

<p>Two hundred years later as the video below shows, Charles and Diana were looking more uncomfortable than usual together as they basted in the summer sun in front of the Opera House. Also on the day singer John Farhnam won the Australian of the Year and the biggest Indigenous land rights protest took place. It was all happening on the 26th of January, 1988. If Captain Phillip had been alive to see what he and his fleet had started two centuries earlier, he might have wondered, "How the devil did they build that peculiar bridge?"</p>

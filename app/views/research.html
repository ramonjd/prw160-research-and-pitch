  <h1>1988 in Australia <small>Life and events</small></h1>
</div>

<p>Were I to draw solely upon my memories of my childhood in Australia during the 1980s as source material for my novel, I’d probably end up creating a golden-syrup dripping fantasy land in which birds flocked to my shoulders wherever I went and the men and women wearing oversized grey suits and shoulder pads running the country could be taken at their word.</p>

<p>One knows better with age, and a genuine reason why I wanted to set a story in this period, was to examine many of the events of the time, from which my pre-pubescent youth stole their relevance and interestingness. </p>

<p>Australia had just crawled its way out of recession and was sighing and moaning its way into another. In 1988 we were told to celebrate the 200th anniversary of English settlement, without really being told why we should, and when people dared to raise such blasphemies as the maltreatment of the Indigenous population<sup referencelink="4"></sup> or the recent repudiation of the white australia immigration policy conceived at the nation’s federation, their cries were drowned out by dentally endowed media commentators among the gratuitous flag-waving and shimmering barbeque haze.</p>

<p>Similar to me, tHe protagonist in my story will observe most of the events happening beyond his immediate sphere with passivity, oblvious that certain facets of the era affect him and those around him.</p>

            <p>Australia marks 200 since the arrival of the 'First Fleet': eleven boats filled mostly with the convicted criminals who were to set the genetic foundation stone for many of its twenty-first century politicians.</p>
            <p>To celebrate, they decided to reenact the voyage (this time without the smallpox and three per cent death rates). Eleven tall ships set out from Portsmouth, England May 13, 1987 and arrived in Sydney Harbour on Jan 26.</p>
